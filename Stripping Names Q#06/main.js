//Stripping Names: Store a personâ€™s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name. 
//Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once.
// Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed. Then print the name after striping the white spaces.
